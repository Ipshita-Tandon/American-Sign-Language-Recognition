# American-Sign-Language-Recognition

American Sign Language (ASL) is a vital mode of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Advances in technology have led to the development of systems that bridge the communication gap between sign language users and the wider community. This unique and expressive language relies on handshapes, facial expressions, and body movements to convey meaning. A standard approach involves collecting a diverse dataset of ASL gestures, preprocessing the data to extract relevant features, and training a machine learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to recognize these gestures. The trained model would be capable of converting hand and finger movements captured through video recordings into text, thereby enabling seamless communication between ASL users and those unfamiliar with sign language. This paper offers insights into the technical aspects of ASL detection using machine learning and underscores its potential to revolutionise communication inclusivity for diverse communities.
